# Note-a-matic-csv
Note-a-matic-csv is the app to summarize video content in text form

OBJECTIVE:

The objective of this project is to design a software that will automatically extract the information in the text form from the video clips. The resulting summary report allows individual users, such as professional information consumers, to quickly go through the document for future references.

APPLICATION:

The project can find its use mainly in the student community, this will help them in making notes summary of what they learn through online video lectures, tutorials, without pausing the video and writing them which is a time-consuming process. It will really save the time and effort of the process of learning through videos.

JUSTIFICATION OF CATEGORY CHOSEN: .

BASIC EXPLANATION OF PROJECT:

In this project, we will use Natural Language Processing to extract the text from speech in the summarize form. We will basically use speech segmentation and automatic summarizer to implement the idea

TENTATIVE TIMELINE:

Week 1 - Designing Prototype
Week 2 to 4 - Development of algorithm for content summarization Week 5 - Testing of the software Week 6 - Analysis of test results Week 7 -Flaw rectification, debugging and final run

FEASIBILITY AND SCOPE OF PROJECT:

The software uses basic algorithms of NLP to implement the idea. These are also one of the most researched one and thus will be easy to apply and execute. Scope of this project spans all the online users who learn different skills, concept & courses using video content and video tutorials
